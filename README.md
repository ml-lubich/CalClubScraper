## Installation Steps 
1. Install node on your local system
2. Install npm packages using `npm install`
3. Start both node instances by running `node index.js` in both the `/client` and `/server` folders.
4. Put that url into the `Server URI` input from the client and click connect
5. (Optional) To establish connections from outside the local network, I recommend ngrok as a proxy for `server/index.js`.
